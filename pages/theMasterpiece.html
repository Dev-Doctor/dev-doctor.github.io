                <p>
                    BioShock was released to a world of video-game fans practically begging to
                    crucify it. The hype surrounding the so-called “revolutionary” first-person shooter had grown to
                    seemingly unrealistic levels during its five-year production period. Early reviews heralded it as
                    the video game to end all video games; a cinematic, life-changing experience that would alter the
                    very nature of the industry; and a goddamned masterful work of capital-A Art — it seemed practically
                    destined to disappoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, the funny thing is, it somehow didn’t.
                </p>
                <p>BioShock not only lived up to these sky-high expectations, it surpassed them. Critics and players
                    alike were blown away by the first-person shooter. Everything about it seemed to not only be better
                    than the games that had come before, but jaw-droppingly different.</p>
                <p>
                    It’s been ten years since the release, and BioShock is still just as beloved as the day it came out.
                    The impact the game has had on the genre as a whole cannot be overstated; its influence is even
                    apparent in recent games like <i>The Last of Us</i> and <i>Prey</i>. 
                </p>
                <h2><i>“We all make choices, but in the end, our choices make us.”</i></h2>
                <p>
                    “What sets BioShock apart was that it was one of the first in the first-person-shooter genre where
                    the story was as important as the visuals,” said Chris Melissinos, curator of the Smithsonian’s 2012
                    exhibition, “The Art of Video Games,” which explored the short history of video games as an accepted
                    artistic medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Narrative alone, BioShock is a force to be reckoned with. The plot is rich and novelesque in a way
                    that was pretty much unheard of for a first-person shooter in the late 2000s. The game takes place
                    in a mysterious underwater utopia called Rapture, which turns out to be an Ayn Rand–esque experiment
                    for the rich and powerful that has, by the time that you arrive, deteriorated into a hellish
                    madhouse ruled by chaos and violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its most basic level, the game is about your quest to get out of the crumbling Art Deco–inspired
                    city, while the voice of a mysterious Irishman named Atlas guides you; but, in practice, the journey
                    that you embark on during these roughly 15 hours of gameplay is much more complicated than that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take ADAM, an in-game resource necessary to participate in and complete BioShock. ADAM, which you
                    use to obtain skill-enhancing serums called Plasmids, can only be found in one place throughout the
                    game: within the bodies of very young, doll-like girls called Little Sisters, protected by large
                    monsters called Big Daddies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any other game, the natural progression of events would be simple: You fight off the Big Daddy,
                    harvest the ADAM from the Little Sisters — perhaps feel a little squeamish about killing them in the
                    process, but do it anyway because you have no choice — and then continue about the game, life force
                    replenished. But this is where BioShock begins to undeniably stand apart from its predecessors.
                    After you have vanquished the Big Daddy, you’re faced with a seemingly strange choice as you gaze
                    upon the quivering face of the Little Sister: HARVEST or RESCUE?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game explains that if you harvest the Little Sister, you’ll have to gruesomely murder her
                    (onscreen), but you get the maximum amount of ADAM possible; while if you choose to rescue her, you
                    only get half as much ADAM in exchange for the vague promise that your kindness will somehow be
                    worth your while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems like such a simple choice: It’s a character in a video game — why wouldn’t you harvest her
                    and reap the rewards? Cute as she may be, the Little Sister doesn’t exist; your choice doesn’t have
                    any actual consequence in the real world. Yet, there’s something undeniably visceral that takes over
                    when you’re sitting there, controller in hand, staring up at the face of a whimpering, scared little
                    girl. By requiring you to make the decision — harvest or rescue — the game has made you think about
                    her as something more than just another NPC. She all of a sudden becomes unmistakably real. And — if
                    you’re like me — you can’t bring yourself to click harvest without triggering an existential crisis
                    of epic proportions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emotional impact of moments like these within BioShock are reminiscent of the sort of feelings
                    that arise when watching a good film, or reading a book. It stands out against the sea of other
                    casual, rational choices that exist in the majority of other games.

                <p>Under Here you can find the collection on Steam. When it goes on sale (and its pretty often) it goes down to only 10 bucks.
                    <br>It's a steal for the amount of content and quality you get. 
                    <br>Bioshock, Bioshock 2 and Bioshock Infinite are all masterpieces in their own right.
